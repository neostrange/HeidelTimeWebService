# HeidelTimeWebService
This project contains a simple Flask-based web application that takes plain text as input, annotates it with TIMEX annotations, and returns the result. It uses the Heideltime engine at the backend. The web service transforms the native output of Heideltime into standalone XML-based annotations which also contains the annotated text spans' starting and ending indexes. Additionally, a Docker file is also included for easy deployment.
